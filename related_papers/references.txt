1. **Real Time Classification of Retail Theft Utilizing YOLO Algorithm**
   - *Focus:* Behavioral anomaly detection using YOLOv8.
   - *Source:* International Information and Engineering Technology Association (IIETA)
   - *Relevance:* High. Benchmarks YOLOv8 speed/accuracy in retail.

2. **Retail Theft Detection System Using Yolov8 and Deepsort**
   - *Focus:* Tracking items to prevent "scan avoidance".
   - *Source:* IJSREM
   - *Relevance:* Demonstrates the "tracking" approach vs. your "verification" approach.

3. **Exploring Pose-Based Anomaly Detection for Retail Security**
   - *Focus:* Using pose estimation to see if a customer *actually* scanned an item.
   - *Source:* arXiv
   - *Relevance:* Complementary approach (checking user action vs. checking item identity).

4. **Enhancing Retail Product Recognition using Modified YOLOv8**
   - *Focus:* Improving recognition of similar-looking products (fine-grained classification).
   - *Relevance:* Directly related to distinguishing "Maggi Curry" from "Maggi Chicken".
